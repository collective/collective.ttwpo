=================
collective.ttwpo
=================

Translations for Plone UI through-the-web (TTW) with option to connect to translation web-services.

Features
========

- Create an i18n-domain and languages variants TTW (also delete them).
- Add GNU Gettext (``*.po``) files TTW to a language.
- Manage different versions of a GNU Gettext file and set one as current.
- Fetch GNU Gettext files from configured translations services. So far only `Zanata <http://zanata.org/>`_ is supported.

Current Limitations
===================

- it is not yet possible to override global, file-system configured (zcml) i18n-domains (see todo).


Installation
============

Install collective.ttwpo by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.ttwpo


and then running ``bin/buildout``.

Example using the ``Zanata`` webservice connector::

    eggs =
        collective.ttwpo[zanata]

After installation activate it in the addons control-panel.
Visit the new ``TTW PO Support`` control-panel.

Configuring a webservice
========================

For each i18n-domain provide a JSON configuration like so:

::

    {
        "servicename":"zanata",
        "url":"https://zanata.mydomain.com/rest/",
        "user":"johndoe",
        "token":"abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
        "project": "mydemo.project",
        "version": "1.x",
        "document": "zanata-document-name"
    }

The key ``servicename`` is mandatory and used to look a up a named adapter.
All other settings are adapter specific and are passed as-is to the adapter.


Todo/ Nice-to-Have
==================

- Allow single users or groups to manage a language: create/delete/make current/sync.

- Download uploaded PO files.

- If an i18n-domain was already registered global, use their catalogs.
  Order: First local catalog, then global catalogs.

- Make upload capability configurable.

- Add Transifex connector.

- Allow environment variables in webservice configuration, which then are replaced.

- If a webservice was configured, sync all languages at once.
  Create missing languages.

- GenericSetup import/ export of the whole configuration.
